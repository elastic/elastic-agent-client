    // expected to be running.

    // Each configuration block included in the expected message is accompanied by an index or

    // field. The agent does not fully parse or inspect the contents of the source field and
    // passes it through to components unmodified.
    //
    // Use of the source field allows the input configurations to evolve without needing to modify
    // the control protocol itself. In some cases commonly used or important fields are extracted as
    // a dedicated message type, but these definitions do not comletely define the contents of the
